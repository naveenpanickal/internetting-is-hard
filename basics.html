    <h1>Internetting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings defines the outline of the website. There are 6 types of headings.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you construct an unoredered list</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element </li>
        <li>Add each element in its own "li" element </li>
        <li>No particular order is required</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is how ordered lists looks like</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
        <li>Here the order is important.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to give emphasis to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Othertimes, you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or a phrase.</p>
    <p><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></p>
    <h2>Line breaks</h2>
